# Explanation
In this project, I have implemented Face Distance Detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe. OpenCV provides powerful computer vision functionalities, including face detection, while MediaPipe offers pre-trained models for face detection and facial landmark detection. By combining these libraries, I am able to accurately detect faces in a video stream or image and measure the distance between them. This project can be used for various applications such as social distancing enforcement, facial analysis, and research studies. It enables tracking the distance between faces and taking necessary precautions for maintaining a safe distance.
